VirtualFileSystem
-----------------
Runs both on Windows and Ubuntu.

In windows PLATFORM_Windows needs to be defined which i did as preprocessor defenition in Visual Studio.
For Linux a make file was made using Genie. The genie.lua file is in the scripts directory. This file adds the PLATFORM_Linux defenition for running on Linux.

On windows the file structure used was on the D-drive
On Ubuntu I used /home/mike and recrated the same structure. It is included in this zip in the FileStructureUsedToTest folder.

I used git to transfer the project from Ubuntu to Windows.
You can find the project on github here: https://github.com/Spellblast/VirtualFileSystem
